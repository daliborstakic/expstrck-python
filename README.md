# Expense Tracker

## What I've done
I've wanted to make a program which can track expense, just the name and the cost of the expense. I've made a separate file for the Expense class, and one separate for the ***GUI***.
The program has the functionality to store the expenses in a *.csv* file, so it can be tracked out of the program.

## What I hope to implement
I would like to rework the GUI. It's quite dull to look at.
